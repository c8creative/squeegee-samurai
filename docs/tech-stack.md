| Server      | Express (local dev)    | Vercel serverless in production          |
| DB client   | `pg`                   | Postgres only                            |

| Storage     | Supabase Storage       | Private bucket for PDF hosting           |

- Local dev: Express server in `api/` (`npm run dev`)
- Production: Vercel serverless routes in `api-serverless/`
- API surface: `POST /api/quote`, `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/test-pdf`
- No auth, sessions, or user/role models for MVP.

## Data

|----------|------------|--------------------------------|
| Database | PostgreSQL | Hosted on Supabase             |
| Storage  | Supabase Storage | Private `quotes` bucket for PDFs |
| Schema   | `quotes` table | See [schema.md](./schema.md)  |

- Database and storage accessed only server-side; no direct client access.

|----------|---------------------------------|
| Resend   | Customer quote PDF delivery     |

## PDF Generation
| Component | Choice               | Notes                           |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Library   | `@react-pdf/renderer`| React components → PDF buffer   |
| Storage   | Supabase Storage     | Private bucket, signed URLs     |
| Delivery  | Resend email         | Link-based (not attachment)     |

- PDFs generated server-side as Buffer (no external image fetches).
- Uploaded to private Supabase Storage bucket (`quotes`).
- Time-limited signed URLs (default 72 hours).
- See [pdf-implementation](./pdf-implimentation/pdf-implementation-complete.md) for full details.

## Hosting
| Component | Target              | Alternative        |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Frontend  | Vercel (static)     | —                  |
| API       | Vercel Serverless   | Supabase Edge Fns  |
| Database  | Supabase Postgres   | Any Postgres       |
| Storage   | Supabase Storage    | Any S3-compatible  |

- Config via env vars; no provider lock-in in code.
- `vercel.json` at repo root configures build and routing.

## Out of Scope (MVP)
- **User login/signup**: Not needed for quote submission.
- **CRM / dashboard**: Owner manages leads externally.
- **Scheduling / invoicing / payments**: Future scope.
